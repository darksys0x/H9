# H9 Memorey Tool

## Overview

**H9** is an advanced memory-scanning tool designed specifically for detecting malicious Win32 APIs in the Import Address Table (IAT) of processes while they are actively running in memory. This tool is capable of identifying and collecting both 32-bit and 64-bit processes in real-time, making it highly versatile and comprehensive for threat detection across multiple architectures.

By using a rule-based methodology, **H9** enables a highly precise and targeted approach to detecting malware or any unauthorized modifications within processes. It effectively distinguishes between normal and suspicious API calls, providing security analysts with crucial insights into potential malicious behavior in the system.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Memory Scanning**: **H9** can actively monitor processes running in memory, ensuring that it captures even transient or fleeting malicious activity.
  
- **Win32 API Detection in IAT**: The tool focuses on analyzing the Import Address Table (IAT) of processes, which is often targeted by malware for API hooking, code injection, and other malicious activities.

- **Support for 32-bit and 64-bit Processes**: **H9** supports both 32-bit and 64-bit processes, enabling it to cover a wide range of applications and system processes without any limitations.

- **Rule-Based Detection**: Utilizing a sophisticated rule-based detection mechanism, the tool can identify specific patterns associated with known and unknown malware, increasing the accuracy and reducing false positives.

- **Targeted Detection**: Instead of scanning the entire memory, **H9** focuses specifically on key points like the IAT, allowing for more focused, resource-efficient detection.

## How It Works

1. **Process Enumeration**: **H9** begins by enumerating all running processes in memory, gathering both 32-bit and 64-bit processes for inspection.
   
2. **Import Address Table (IAT) Scanning**: Once processes are collected, the tool inspects the IAT of each process, detecting any anomalies or unauthorized API calls. It uses predefined rules that can be updated or customized for specific threats or behaviors.
   
3. **Malicious API Detection**: The rule-based system flags suspicious APIs, especially those commonly associated with malware activity (e.g., hooks, injected code, tampered function pointers).

4. **Reporting**: The tool outputs the results, highlighting processes with potential malicious activity and providing insights into the specific APIs or addresses that were flagged.

## Use Cases

- **Incident Response**: Security teams can use **H9** during an incident to detect and isolate malicious processes in real-time.
  
- **Threat Hunting**: The tool is useful for proactively scanning systems to identify any hidden or stealthy malware that may not be detected by conventional AV or EDR solutions.
  
- **Malware Analysis**: Analysts can leverage **H9** to monitor malware behavior, particularly how it interacts with the system's Win32 APIs during runtime.

## Future Development

Upcoming features for **H9** include:

- Enhanced rule customization for specific threat environments.
- Integration with threat intelligence platforms for rule updates.
- Improved detection of obfuscated and encrypted API calls.
